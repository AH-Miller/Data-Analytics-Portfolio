# Data-Analytics-Portfolio

A place where I showcase my skills and upload my data analytics case studies.

I recently completed Google's Data Analytics Professional [Certificate](https://coursera.org/share/81b213d26b7e426bb576c0efe0a73fc5), to learn and re-learn some of the important data skills needed as a data professional. Uploaded is my final capstone project for the certificate.

I hope to upload more to this repository soon, whether it be more case studies or more specific showcases of certain skills such as Tableau and SQL.
