My attempts at the [Quantium Data Analytics Job Simulation](https://www.theforage.com/simulations/quantium/data-analytics-rqkb)

Reflections from Part 1:
- Much of the code in the sample solutions was much simpler due to using the capabilities of data.table package, so I will be making an effort to wrap my head around that
- Also should attempt to further understand ggplot2 and it's capabilities, as the plots in the sample solutions were far more elegant and informative than my own.
