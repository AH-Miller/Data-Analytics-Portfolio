My completed capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate capstone project. The project followed all steps of the Data Analytics lifecycle (Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, Act) and used skills in Excel, Tableau and R. The case study I chose involved using data from a bikeshare company to determine what marketing strategies could be used to convince casual users of the service to become members. 

Disclaimer, the R code was mostly not my own, and was provided by Google with the project. I hope to showcase original in R for other tasks in the future.
